on damage -> change % based on damage, but don't do damage on player
on projectile hit -> get vector projectile/player -> bump in that direction based on the hitted player %
bounce on the ground -> change movement state for x seconds based on speed/curb
nerfing crouch (blocking crouch for x second on hit)
nerfing spam grapple to stop momentum (same than before)
